NOTE:<br>
<br>
Beta Frame Build is for those few people that have the 420mm horizontal and 555mm vertical 3030 extrusions. Some printed parts are resized to fit this build. Some fasteners and other non-printed parts still need to be added to this CAD model.<br>
<br>
Production Frame Build has been extended in XYZ to allow for a full 300mm cubic build volume, and will have 430mm horizontal and 600mm vertical 3030 extrusions. Contains all fasteners and other non-printed parts (although we are only human, and may have missed something).<br>
