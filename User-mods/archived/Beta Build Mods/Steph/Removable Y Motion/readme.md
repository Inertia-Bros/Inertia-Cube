# Removable Y Motion

I created this mod to allow people to more easily remove the Y motion parts for service/maintenance/replacement/kicks.

To remove each Y motion part, simply remove six screws from the assembly: two from the rear motor mount, two from the XY joint on the same side, and two from the front motor mount. With a bit of effort and elbow grease, you can then pop out the motion part in question.

Currently available in 2 flavours (because I had the parts on hand)

- For 12mm linear rods and bearings
- For 8mm linear rods and bearings

Want me to add some other options to this list? Let me know!
