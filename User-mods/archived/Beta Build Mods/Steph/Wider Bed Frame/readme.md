# Wider Bed Frame

I did this because it was Kyle's fault.

Originally, the CAD had the front and rear bed extrusions at a 310mm length, because that's what Kyle had on hand.
I couldn't easily source 310mm extrusions from Amazon, but the more common 300mm extrusions were readily available.
I ended up ordering the 310mm extrusions directly from Misumi, and had them drill the center holes for the blind joints with the bed middle extrusion.
And right after I did that, Kyle changed the length of the extrusions in the CAD to 300mm instead.

So this mod will likely never see a second build, but in case someone has 310mm extrusions on hand and needs for the printed parts to fit, well here you go!

Note the 2mm air gap between the ends of the front and rear bed extrusions and the printed parts. This air gap improves air flow (it doesn't) and allows the bed to heat up faster, or is it the chamber (well, neither actually).
