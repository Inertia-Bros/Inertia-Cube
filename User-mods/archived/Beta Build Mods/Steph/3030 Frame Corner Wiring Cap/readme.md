# 3030 Frame Corner Wiring Cap

I designed these because I wanted to run LED wires in the inside extrusions slots around the top of the frame, and the wires then needed to "jump" over the corner Z extrusion to the next extrusion slot.

This part makes it so that you can do that, and no wires are visible.
