# Annex Panel Clips for 3030 Extrusions

Many thanks to Anlin from the Annex Engineering team for their original design!

I love using variations of these clips on all of my printers, as they hold the panels in securely, and require no cutting or drilling of the panels, and no additional hardware. They are also easily removable.
To make these, I simply scaled the 2020 versions up 33% in the X and Y dimensions, leaving the Z dimension alone.
I only remixed the 5.5mm tall versions, as with a 3mm panel and 3mm foam tape, 5.5mm gives just enough compression to the foam that everything stays nice and snug.
