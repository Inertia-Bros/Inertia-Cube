# Daylight on a Stick Diffuser Mount for 3030 extrusions

I remixed this from https://www.printables.com/model/795364-voron-discodaylight-on-a-stick-led-mount-tray-with, removing some of the mounting holes (IMHO it doesn't need 5 of them), and moving the remaining mounting holes 2mm up, so that this would fit on 3030 extrusions with 3mm of clearance for a panel to rest on top.
