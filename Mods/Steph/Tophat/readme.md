# Tophat

I took the design for the skirts and feet and flipped them upside down, then modified the top surface so that the top face of the top panel sits flush with the top face of the Tophat parts. I then created a strip of "caps" above that, which are attached via 6x3mm magnets to the Tophat parts.

Print 4x of each part. Grills and supports are included as separate files, so feel free to print them or not, as you prefer. Grills could be printed completely separately then glued, if you don't have an MMU capable printer.

STLs are oriented as I would print them, although there are other possible orientations that would also work.

## BOM:
- 40x 6x3mm magnets
