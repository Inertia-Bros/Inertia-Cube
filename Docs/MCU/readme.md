## Octopus PRO MCU (H723 STM Chipset)
The Octopus PRO MCU with the H723 Chipset is more than capable of running Kalico and Klipper. 

## KRAKEN
THe KRAKEN MCU is a capable MCU you need to realize that the z motors are going to get the same voltage as the gantry with no voltage selection. You get what you put in.

STRONGLY urge you to stick with 24v on this one.
