## Welcome to the Inertia Cube Project!

![INERTIA FOR GIT](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29671981-ddff-4e28-8bd0-1bb939765305)

The Inertia Cube is a high speed FDM 3D printer that looks to optimize simplicity and provide a great entry point for all makers into the world of All Wheel Drive 3D printing. Its 300mm^3 build volume is built on a CoreXY frame, optimized for ease of assembly, speed, and precision, while ensuring long-lasting performance and unmatched serviceability for enthusiasts who demand speed without compromising quality and those who need high printing uptime.

**World’s FIRST production printer featuring Monolith Style Belt routing!** 

Thanks to the great work done over the last 2 years by CloakedWayne we have a fully optimized belt path for AWD printers that looks to minimize hardware and belt length, while providing incredible results in the process. We strongly encourage you to support his work via his [Kofi](https://ko-fi.com/cloakedwayne).

What makes it special? Some affectionately refer to the Inertia Cube as “baby’s first AWD printer” due to the incredibly simple assembly and design intent that makes it incredibly easy to achieve near peak performance out of the printer regardless of DIY build experience.

Printer features:
- Fixed gantry increases toolhead stability
- Inverted electronics bay for ease of access and wiring
- New extruder design which is a marriage of JaredC's G2SA and LDO's Orbiter2 parts to maximize extrusion force
- New single part toolhead design heavily inspired by Chirpy's Yavoth toolhead, optimized for rigidity and expanded compatibility
- Monolith AWD style gantry heavily inspired by CloakedWayne
- Linear rods for Y axis motion for self alignment and simplicity
- 4 Z leadscrew motors for Quad Bed Leveling
- Support for USB or CAN Bus eddy current scanners as the Z probe
- Support for USB or CAN Bus Toolhead PCBs (LDO NH36, Fysetc H36, or BTT EBB36)
- Support for various hotends (starting with Rapido UHF, Dragon Ace Volcanao UHF, and Goliath)
- A 3030 extrusion remix of Anlin's excellent Annex Panel Clips
- An independent extrusion style front door

**What is AWD (All Wheel Drive)?**
>While most CoreXY printers rely on a two-motor drive system, the Inertia Cube leverages an advanced four-motor setup—two at the front and two at the back. This innovative >design shortens the belt path, minimizes belt stretch, improves acceleration, and yields better input shaping results. With the added torque from the extra motors, >acceleration performance is typically 1.5 times greater than traditional two-motor systems.

**What is the best performance hardware?**
>For optimal results, we recommend using LDO-42STH48-2504AC or 2504AH 1.8-degree motors paired with 20-tooth pulleys and EPDM GT2 belts if possible.
