## Welcome to the Inertia Cube Project!

The Inertia Cube represents a groundbreaking leap in 3D printing technology. This innovative design ensures superior rigidity and precision by eliminating gantry skew with robust 12mm rods. It’s a 300mm-sized FDM 3D printer built on a CoreXY frame, optimized for ease of assembly, speed, and precision, while ensuring long-lasting performance for enthusiasts who demand speed without compromising quality.

**World’s FIRST production printer featuring Cloaked Wayne’s Monolith Style Gantry!** (Yes, we have his blessing.)

What makes it special? Some affectionately refer to the Inertia Cube as “baby’s first AWD printer” due to its distinctive gantry design.

What is AWD (All Wheel Drive)? While most CoreXY printers rely on a two-motor drive system, the Inertia Cube leverages an advanced four-motor setup—two at the front and two at the back. This innovative design shortens the belt path, minimizes belt stretch, improves acceleration, and yields better input shaping results. With the added torque from the extra motors, acceleration performance is typically 1.5 times greater than traditional two-motor systems.

For optimal results, we recommend using LDO-42STH48-2504AC or 2504AH 1.8-degree motors paired with 20-tooth pulleys.

Features:
- Fixed gantry increases toolhead stability
- Inverted electronics bay for ease of access and wiring
- New extruder design which is a marriage of JaredC's G2SA and LDO's Orbiter2 parts
- New single part toolhead design heavily inspired by Chirpy's Yavoth toolhead
- Monolith AWD gantry for extra performance (thanks to Cloaked Wayne!)
- Removable Y linear rods for easy maintenance
- 4 Z leadscrew motors for Quad Gantry Leveling
- Either USB or CAN Bus eddy current scanners as the Z probe
- Either USB or CAN Bus Toolhead PCBs (LDO NH36 or BTT EBB36)
- Support for various hotends (starting with Rapido UHF, Dragon UHF, and Goliath)
- A 3030 extrusion remix of Anlin's excellent Annex Panel Clips
- Clicky-Clack style front door (thanks to Whopping Pochard!)
