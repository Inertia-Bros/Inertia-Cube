> ## What is it?
>
>The ultimate extruder for the Inertia Cube! - Designed with a few things in mind, Torque, Precision, easy load / unload, keep up with the speeds and accelerations of the IÂ³, and of course stability for MMU.
>- Key take aways here.... You do NOT have to use and or build an MMU to use this extruder, the endstop switch at the top of the extruder can also act as a built-in Filament Run-Out sensor!
>

> [!NOTE]
> Inspiration derived from Orbiter, G2SA, and my obsession with more torque for filament.
>
> Thank you Dr. Lorincz for creating/implementing the original planetary gearset design for use on extruders in the first place! Your designs and years of innovations ultimately lead JaredC01 down a path using different sizes for the planet gears and Ring Gear creating an open-source design known as the G2.
